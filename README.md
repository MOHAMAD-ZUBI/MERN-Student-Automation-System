   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-automation-system.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd student-automation-system
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up MongoDB:**
   - Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running.
   - Configure the database connection in the `server/config/keys.js` file.
